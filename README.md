During my internship at Codsoft, I had the chance to work on multiple projects that expanded my front-end development skills. I designed and developed a dynamic travel website landing page using HTML and CSS, creating an intuitive experience for users to explore and select holiday destinations. Additionally, I built a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enhanced my understanding of JavaScript logic and interactive web components. These projects allowed me to further refine my skills in responsive design and user-centric development.
